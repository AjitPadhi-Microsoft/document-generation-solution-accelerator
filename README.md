**Solution accelerator overview**

This solution accelerator is a powerful tool that helps you create your own AI assistant(s). The accelerator can be used by any customer looking for reusable architecture and code snippets to build an AI assistant(s) with their own enterprise data. 

It leverages Azure Open AI Service and Azure AI Search, to identify relevant documents, summarize unstructured information, and generate Word document templates using your own data. 

**Scenario**

This example focuses on a generic use case - chat with your own data, generate a document template using your own data, and exporting the document in a docx format.

The sample data is sourced from 1) generic AI-generated promissory notes and 2) a select set of research and grants published on PubMed and NIH.
The documents are intended for use as sample data only.

### Environment variables

Note: settings starting with `AZURE_SEARCH` are only needed when using Azure OpenAI on your data with Azure AI Search. If not connecting to your data, you only need to specify `AZURE_OPENAI` settings.

| App Setting | Value | Note |
| --- | --- | ------------- |
|AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE||The name of your Azure AI Search resource|
|AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX||The name of your Azure AI Search Index|
|AZURE_SEARCH_KEY||An **admin key** for your Azure AI Search resource|
|AZURE_SEARCH_USE_SEMANTIC_SEARCH|False|Whether or not to use semantic search|
|AZURE_SEARCH_QUERY_TYPE|simple|Query type: simple, semantic, vector, vectorSimpleHybrid, or vectorSemanticHybrid. Takes precedence over AZURE_SEARCH_USE_SEMANTIC_SEARCH|
|AZURE_SEARCH_SEMANTIC_SEARCH_CONFIG||The name of the semantic search configuration to use if using semantic search.|
|AZURE_SEARCH_TOP_K|5|The number of documents to retrieve from Azure AI Search.|
|AZURE_SEARCH_ENABLE_IN_DOMAIN|True|Limits responses to only queries relating to your data.|
|AZURE_SEARCH_CONTENT_COLUMNS||List of fields in your Azure AI Search index that contains the text content of your documents to use when formulating a bot response. Represent these as a string joined with "|", e.g. `"product_description|product_manual"`|
|AZURE_SEARCH_FILENAME_COLUMN|| Field from your Azure AI Search index that gives a unique identifier of the source of your data to display in the UI.|
|AZURE_SEARCH_TITLE_COLUMN||Field from your Azure AI Search index that gives a relevant title or header for your data content to display in the UI.|
|AZURE_SEARCH_URL_COLUMN||Field from your Azure AI Search index that contains a URL for the document, e.g. an Azure Blob Storage URI. This value is not currently used.|
|AZURE_SEARCH_VECTOR_COLUMNS||List of fields in your Azure AI Search index that contain vector embeddings of your documents to use when formulating a bot response. Represent these as a string joined with "|", e.g. `"product_description|product_manual"`|
|AZURE_SEARCH_PERMITTED_GROUPS_COLUMN||Field from your Azure AI Search index that contains AAD group IDs that determine document-level access control.|
|AZURE_SEARCH_STRICTNESS|3|Integer from 1 to 5 specifying the strictness for the model limiting responses to your data.|
|AZURE_OPENAI_RESOURCE||the name of your Azure OpenAI resource|
|AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL||The name of your model deployment|
|AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT||The endpoint of your Azure OpenAI resource.|
|AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_NAME|gpt-35-turbo-16k|The name of the model|
|AZURE_OPENAI_KEY||One of the API keys of your Azure OpenAI resource|
|AZURE_OPENAI_TEMPERATURE|0|What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. A value of 0 is recommended when using your data.|
|AZURE_OPENAI_TOP_P|1.0|An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. We recommend setting this to 1.0 when using your data.|
|AZURE_OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS|1000|The maximum number of tokens allowed for the generated answer.|
|AZURE_OPENAI_STOP_SEQUENCE||Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. Represent these as a string joined with "|", e.g. `"stop1|stop2|stop3"`|
|AZURE_OPENAI_SYSTEM_MESSAGE|You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.|A brief description of the role and tone the model should use|
|AZURE_OPENAI_PREVIEW_API_VERSION|2024-02-15-preview|API version when using Azure OpenAI on your data|
|AZURE_OPENAI_STREAM|True|Whether or not to use streaming for the response|
|AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_NAME||The name of your embedding model deployment if using vector search.
|UI_TITLE|Contoso| Chat title (left-top) and page title (HTML)
|UI_LOGO|| Logo (left-top). Defaults to Contoso logo. Configure the URL to your logo image to modify.
